# Riot Account Manager

Riot Account Manager makes it easier to swap between different accounts. 

When the Riot login page opens up, a window with different options will pop up.

You can choose to login to one of your profiles or to add, edit or remove a profile.

All the accounts are stored in your /appdata/local directory and the app does not interact with anything else than your riot client and file that stores the profiles.
